                <h3>Here is a timeline of the true political statesman’s life</h3>
                <li><strong>Birth: December 25, 1924</strong> - Vajpayee was born in Gwalior and did his schooling from the Saraswati Shishu Mandir. He graduated with distinction in Hindi, English and Sanskrit from Gwalior's Victoria College. He completed his post-graduation with an MA in Political Science from DAV College, Kanpur.</li>
                <li><strong>1939</strong> - Joined Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in the capacity of a swayamsevak. He was greatly influenced by Babasaheb Apte and joined the RSS as a full time worker in 1947.</li>
                <li><strong>1942</strong> - This was the year when Atal Bihari Vajpayee had his first exposure to the realm of politics when he was arrested for 23 days during the Quit Ibndia Movement. His brother was also jailed during the same time with him.</li>
                <li><strong>1951</strong> - In 1951, he was seconded by the RSS, along with Deendayal Upadhyaya, to work for the newly formed Bharatiya Jana Sangh. He was appointed the national secretary of BJS in Delhi and became a follower of party leader Syama Prasad Mookerjee.</li>
                <li><strong>1953</strong> - In 1953, Vajpayee accompanied Mookerjee when the latter went on a fast-unto-death in Kashmir to protest against 'inferior' treatment of non-Kashmiri visitors to the Valley. Mookerjee passed away in prison during this strike.</li>
                <li><strong>1957</strong> - Having contested the Lok Sabha polls on three seats, Vajpayee lost to Raja Mahendra Pratap in Mathura, and also in Lucknow. But he was elected to the Lok Sabha from UP’s Balrampur. Vajpayee took oath as a member of Parliament that year and impressed Parliament with his extraordinary oratory skills. Vajpayee's oratorial skills won him the reputation of being the most eloquent defender of the Jana Sangh's policies. </li>
                <li><strong>1962</strong> - Beacame Member of Rajya Sabha</li>
                <li><strong>1968</strong> - Vajpayee was made the national president of the Jana Sangh in 1968 after the death of Deendayal Upadhyaya. In the years that followed, he worked with Lal Krishna Advani, Nanaji Deshmukh and Balraj Madhok to make Jana Sangh's presence prominent in Indian politics.</li>
                <li><strong>1973</strong> - Atal Bihari Vajpayee arrived at Parliament House in a bullock cart to protest against the increase in petrol and kerosene prices on November 12, 1973</li>
                <li><strong>1975-1977</strong> - Vajpayee spent months in prison when Indira Gandhi imposed Emergency in June 1975. When the Janata Party took office in 1977, dethroning the Congress for the first time, he became the Minister of External Affairs in Prime Minister Morarji Desai’s government. As foreign minister, Vajpayee that year became the first person to deliver speech at the United Nations General Assembly in Hindi.</li>
                <li><strong>1980</strong> - Vajpayee, along with Lal Krishna Advani and Bhairon Singh Shekhawat founded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party">Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)</a> in 1980 and was appointed its first president. (Today Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is the largest political party in the world.)</li>
                <li><strong>1984-1989</strong> - In the 1984 elections, following the assassination of the then PM Indira Gandhi, BJP won only two seats in the 545-member Lok Sabha. This defeat hit Vajpayee particularly hard; he himself lost the polls from his birthplace Gwalior. He worked tirelessly to build the party and in the next parliamentary elections, in 1989, the BJP won 88 seats.</li>
                <li><strong>1991</strong> - By 1991, the BJP had emerged as the principal Opposition party, having won 120 seats in the 1991 parliamentary elections.</li>
                <li><strong>1992</strong> - Atal Bihari Vajpayee was conferred with the Padma Vibhushan for his contribution to the country in 1992.</li>
                <li><strong>1994</strong> - In 1994, he was awarded as the best Parliamentarian.</li>
                <li><strong>1996</strong> - Vajpayee's first stint as the prime minister in 1996 lasted only 13 days, from May 16 to 28. In his reply to Parliament during the no-confidence motion, Vajpayee said, "Political parties will come and go, but India's democracy must live on".</li>

                </div>
                <li><strong>1998</strong> - On May 11, 1998, the world was caught unawares when India did its first official nuclear tests in Rajasthan's Pokhran. The underground tests not only demonstrated the country's scientific capacity but also reflected the courage of Vajpayee's leadership. In the same year, he launched the Sada-e-Sarhad, a bus service between New Delhi in India and Lahore in Pakistan, and symbolic of peace initiatives that he wanted to pursue with the neighbouring country. The service was, however, suspended after the 2001 terror attack on the Indian parliament that nearly led to war between India and Pakistan.</li>
                <li><strong>1999</strong> - The Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was in power at the Centre during the time the Kargil War was fought. India's victory bolstered Vajpayee’s image, and he was praised for supporting the armed forces and clearly articulating India’s stand at the world stage. After the war, he was elected the prime minister for a third time. This term would make Vajpayee India's first non-Congress prime minister to last a full five-year term.</li>
                <li><strong>2002</strong>- When he failed to return to power after the 2004 general elections, though he was given to believe he would, it practically marked the end of his long and eventful political career. A year later, he left active politics.</li>
                <li><strong>2009</strong> - Vajpayee suffered a stroke in 2009 which impaired his speech.</li>
                <li><strong>2018</strong> - On 11 June 2018, Vajpayee was admitted to AIIMS in critical condition following a kidney infection. He was officially declared dead there at 5:05 pm IST on 16 August 2018 at the age of 93.</li>
                <li><strong></strong>Thousands of people and many dignitaries attended his funeral procession including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind. On 19 August, his ashes were immersed in Ganga river at Haridwar by his foster daughter Namita.</li>
